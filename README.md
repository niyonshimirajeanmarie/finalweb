# JM System - Profile Management Web Application

## Project Overview

JM System is a web application built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **PHP**. It allows users to:

- Sign up by entering their full name, email, username, and password.
- View their profile after signing up.

The application uses a **semantic and responsive layout** with HTML5 elements like `header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `article`, `aside`, and `footer` to make the website easy to use and accessible to everyone.
